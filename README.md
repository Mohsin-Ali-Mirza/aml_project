Project Repository

This repository contains two mini-projects related to 03-IMAP-AML Advanced Machine Learning:

# üìÇ Project Folders

## 1. Abstractive Summarization Main Mini Project Using Transformers

This project involves building an abstractive text summarization model using Transformer-based architectures. It covers:

- Data preprocessing
- Fine-tuning a T5 model for summarization
- Evaluating the model using ROUGE metrics

This folder contains two important files:

**ml_training.ipynb**: This notebook involves fine-tuning different transformer architectures on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

**app.py**: A Streamlit app providing a web interface to interact with the trained models. Run the following command to launch the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## 2. Regularization Mini Project (2nd Mini Project)

This project focuses on comparing the effects of different regularization techniques on a simple Neural Network such as:

- No Regularization
- L1 Regularization
- L2 Regularization
- Dropout
